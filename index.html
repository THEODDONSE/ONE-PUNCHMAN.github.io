                <p class="center">The Hero Association (ヒーロー協会, Hīrō Kyōkai) is a superhero organization founded by the multi-millionaire Agoni in order to fight monsters, criminals, and various threats. It uses a Hero Registry to indicate which characters are recognized as professional heroes, with anyone who is not registered to be considered "a pervy freak who spouts irresponsible nonsense." Agoni created the association after his grandson was saved from the monster Crablante by an unknown bystander (who turns out to be Saitama). It is also financed by donations from citizens.Ch. 15 The association is made up of four tiers from the lowest C-Class to the highest S-Class. The heroes within each class are ranked numerically, with the highest rank 1 of each class being eligible to advance to the next tier if they so desire.Vol. 4 New heroes must take an exam in which 50% is a physical test, and the other 50% is a written exam and an essay. A passing grade would be 70% or higher and directly placed in a class from 70% being barely C-class to 100% being eligible for S-class.Ch. 16 They are then placed at the lowest ranking for that tier.Ch. 16 Heroes can ascend or descend in their rankings depending on their deeds; C-Class heroes who are inactive for a week are dropped from the Registry.</p>
